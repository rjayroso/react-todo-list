# Todo List
Todo List is a React app that pulls from a [dummy online REST API](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com) to populate a list of tasks.
This is a mini practice project of mine in which I have learned from a course provided by [Traversy Media](https://www.traversymedia.com/).
## Features :zap:
- A responsive one page layout built with React 
- JSON array management via online web API
## Getting Started :arrow_forward:
Below are instructions on how to try out this React app for yourself.
### Prerequisites :white_check_mark:  
You will need [Git](https://git-scm.com/) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) to pull from this repository and run the server on your own machine. 
### Installation Using Git :package:
First, go to the folder or workspace that you want to clone the repository into:
```bash
cd C:\myprojects
```
Where **myprojects** is where you want to place the repository. 
Next, issue the following commands:
```bash
# Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/rjayroso/react-todo-list.git

# Go into the repository
cd react-todo-list

# Remove current origin repository
git remote remove origin 

# Install dependencies using NPM
npm install

# Start development server
npm start
```
Once it has successfuly compiled, you can go to http://localhost:3000/ to see the development server in action.
